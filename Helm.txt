   To delete all data from a file using vi editor:
     Open that file press escape button then colon %d enter
	esc :%d enter
		
   In VS code to give proper indentation select that block of code and use shift+tab button.	

   Helm is an packaging manager in k8s. In k8s we used diff manifest(YAML) to create diff objects.
   To manage these files is the time consuming task also to increas the replicas we have to make changes manually.
   In Helm we combine all these manifest files in a package and then install it, and this is called Chart.
 
   Helm has three components:
       1. Chart: 
             Helm uses a packaging format called charts. The chart may consists multiple files to create a package.
       2. Release:
             Release is an instance of a chart running in a k8s cluster.
	     In cluster a chart may often installed multiple times, so in each time it will create a new release.
       3. Repository:
             It is a place where all packaging charts are saved.

   Deprecating Charts:
      When managing charts in a Chart Repository, it is sometimes necessary to deprecate a chart. 
      The optional deprecated field in Chart.yaml can be used to mark a chart as deprecated. 
   
   Chart Types:
      The type field defines the type of chart. There are two types: application and library. 
	    1. Application :
                 Application is the default type and it is the standard chart which can be operated on fully. 
	    2. Library :
                 The library chart provides utilities or functions for the chart builder. 
                 A library chart differs from an application chart because it is not installable and usually doesn't 
	         contain any resource objects.

   Chart Dependencies:
      In Helm, one chart may depend on any number of other charts. These dependencies can be dynamically linked 
      using the dependencies field in Chart.yaml or brought in to the charts/ directory and managed manually.

   Helm Chart templates are written in the Go template language.


   The Purpose of Helm
     Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes packages called charts. Helm can do the following:
       Create new charts from scratch
       Package charts into chart archive (tgz) files
       Interact with chart repositories where charts are stored
       Install and uninstall charts into an existing Kubernetes cluster
       Manage the release cycle of charts that have been installed with Helm	

   Helm can work with any version of k8s. It also supports other cloud providers like AKS,GKE,EKS
 
   Helm manages the application in Kubernetes using the following components,
      1. helm: a command line tool that provides the user interface to all Helm functionality
      2. tiller: the server component which runs on the Kubernetes cluster
      3. charts: which is the packaging format in Helm
      4. charts repository: with prepackaged charts for popular open-source software projects
      5. Tiller is used to listen for commands from helm and handle the configuration and deployment of software 
	 release on the Kubernetes cluster. 

   Hooks :
      Hooks are declared as an annotation in the metadata section of the chart.yaml file. Some of the available hooks 
      are as follows,
	 
       1. pre-install: 
	         Executes the required operation after templates are rendered, but before any resources are created in Kubernetes
       2. post-install: 
	         Executes the required operation after all resources are loaded into Kubernetes
       3. pre-delete: 
	         Executes the required operation on a deletion request before any resources are deleted from Kubernetes
       4. post-delete: 
	         Executes the required operation on a deletion request after all of the release’s resources have been deleted.
       5. pre-upgrade: 
	        Executes the required operation on an upgrade request after templates are rendered, but before any resources are  loaded into Kubernetes
                (i.e. before a Kubernetes apply operation)
       6. post-upgrade: 
	        Executes the required operation on an upgrade after all resources have been upgraded
       7. pre-rollback: 
	        Executes the required operation on a rollback request after templates are rendered, but before any resources have been rolled back
       8. post-rollback:
                Executes the required operation on a rollback request after all resources have been modified
       9. crd-install: 
	        Adds CRD resources before any other checks are run. This is used only on CRD definitions that are used by other manifests in the chart
       10. test-success: 
	        Executes the required operation while running helm test and expects the pod to return successfully 
	        (return code == 0)
       11. test-failure: 
	        Executes the required operation while running helm test and expects the pod to fail (return code != 0)


    

   Helm Commands:
       1. helm repo add give_name repo_url
       2. helm repo list
       3. helm install give_name repo_name/pkg_name
 
   To debug we have three methods:
       1. helm lint chart/release_name       -- It will show errors if have. Before uploading to production check this.
       2. helm template chart/release_name   -- It will show errors in template file
       3. helm install give_name --dry-run --debug chart_name

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When you create an chart and after installing you can create release. When you install chart it will create first release.
    Now when you make changes in any of the file and then upgrade it to new version
       helm upgrade release_name chart_name    -- check revision

    When you create any chart as follows:
	  helm create mychart   -- The directory structure as follows will be created 
	    mychart
		|-- Chart.yml		
		|-- charts 
		|-- templates
		|-- values.yml 
		
     These are the main components of chart.
        |-- Chart.yaml
	    |-- charts
		|-- templates
		|   |-- NOTES.txt
		|   |-- _helpers.tpl
		|   |-- deployment.yaml
		|   |-- hpa.yaml
		|   |-- ingress.yaml
		|   |-- service.yaml
		|   |-- serviceaccount.yaml
		|   `-- tests
		|       `-- test-connection.yaml
		`-- values.yaml	  
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    1. helm create mychart
    2. cd mychart
    3. vi values.yml  -- change service type to NodePort so that we can access through web
    4. helm install my_new_chart mychart   -- If you are inside your chart use sdot(.) instead of chart name.
    5. Here my_new_chart is an release.
    6. helm list -a   -- It will show the release list or all data.
    7. By this some k8s objects will be created 
        1. kubectl get svc
        2. kubectl get deployments	   
    8. helm delete release_name/chart_name   -- Check once can we delete release_name 
  
 
  helm templates : 
     1. helm template chart_name  -- It will show the files
	
  helm dry run :
     Used to check any error. It is an advanced version of/for helm lint and helm template.
     It will check in k8s API server for any error as it is done like in production.
         helm install myrelease --dry-run --debug ./chart_name
		 
		 
  helm upgrade :
     It will upgrade the release version. Whenever you made any changes in existing release and want to deploy the same you 
     can use helm upgrade command as :
         helm upgrade release_name chart_name.
            By this check helm list and the version will be upgraded.

  helm variables :
     Add the variable in values.yml file and to use it in any yml file use below syntax :
        {{ Values.variable_name }}  -- 	 
		 
  		 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 To add any depenndent chart we need to add its dependencies in Chart.yml file and the run one command as :
    To add dependencies:
      dependencies:
        - name: Name of the chart that u wnat to add
          version: ""     -- version of the chart chexk from helm.hub site
          repository: ""  -- repository of the chart chexk from helm.hub site

      After this run this command:
            helm dependency update chart_name

      Then check in charts directory one tar file will be there.			




  Template Functions & Pipelines (|) :
    Here we are using diff functions to make the manifest accurate and clear.
	  1. quote ("")
      2. repeat
      3. lower, upper
      4. include    (If you have to add any other YAML file or some function from _helper.tpl file then you can you use this.)
      5. required   (It's like a msg to show user that this filed is imp you have to provide it.)
                    example: time: {{ required "The time is most required" .Values......}}
      6. default    (If no values specified you have to take this as default value)
                    example: city: {{ .Values..... | default "Pune"}}	
      7. nindent    (With this we can provide indentation)
      8. toYaml     (When you have to use other yaml files then use this.)
	  
	  
  Flow Controls:
     1. if/else  (- will remove blank spaces)
	      {{- if data }}
		     Do Something
	      {{- else if data }}
                     Do Something
              {{- else }}
                    Default case
              {{- end }}		  
	   
	   
      2. with
	     {{- with data }}
		  Do Something
	     {{- end }}	
	 
	  
     3. range (Same as for loop)
	     {{- range .Values....}}
	     - {{ .| title |quote }}
	     {{- end }}
       
 	  
  Variables:
     {{- $relname := .Release.Name -}}
	 
	 release: {{ $relname }}
	 
	 
  Named Templates :
    How it is defined:
	
        {{- define "mychart.labels" }}
	       data
	{{- end }}

    How it is called:
	
        {{- template "mychart.labels" . }}

		
		
  Helmfile:
     What is Helmfile & why we need it ?
        This is a kind of yaml file where we can add the info related to helm charts so that using a single command we can install helm charts. (Rahul wagh YouTube)
        There is a syntax for helmfile which we need to look.		
           (https://jhooq.com/getting-start-with-helm-chart/?query=helm)
	
  Installation of helmfile:
      1. First install helm.
      2. wget https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/releases/download/v0.144.0/helmfile_linux_amd64
      3. mv helmfile_linux_amd64 helmfile
      4. chmod 777 helmfile 
      5. mv helmfile /usr/local/bin
      6. helmfile --version
 
  How to use Template and Environment variables insides Helmfile? 
     1. .gotmpl - Any value files with .gotmpl extension will be rendered with template expressions.
     2. .yaml - File ending with .yaml extension will be used as plain value files	

    vi helmfile.yml
	   ---
	   releases:
            - name: helloworld
              chart: ./helloworld
              values:
               - values.yaml.gotmpl

   Let’s consider the values.yaml.gotmpl has following expression -
	  {{ readFile "values.yaml" | fromYaml | setValueAtPath "foo.bar" "FOO_BAR" | toYaml }}
	
   How to pass Environment values into helmfile.yaml
      environments:
        production:
          values:
            - production.yaml
        ---

        releases:
           - name: helloworld1
             chart: ./helloworld1
             installed: true   
	 
	 
	 
    How to use a helm chart which is there in remote github :
	
    ---
    repositories:
      - name: mychart
        url: URL of repo where the chart is present

    releases:
      - name: mychart
        chart: path of chart (Directory wise path)
        installed: true (For installing the chart, False for deleting)
		
	---

    Also we can installed multiple charts usig helmfile as:
    releases:
      - name: mychart
        chart: path of chart (Directory wise path)
        installed: true (For installing the chart, False for deleting)

    releases:
      - name: mychart11
        chart: path of chart (Directory wise path)
        installed: true (For installing the chart, False for deleting)    	

    Using below command we can create charts using helmfile 
	    helmfile sync
		 
	


  Plugins:
    1. diff: Will shows the diff between 2 revisions of helm chart.
	2. helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
	3. helm plugin list
	4. helm create helloworld
	5. helm install myhelloworld helloworld 
	6. Change some data in values.yaml file. Example: replicaCount: 2
	7. helm upgrade myhelloworld .
	8. helm list -a      	
	9. helm diff revision myhelloworld 1 2
   10. helm plugin uninstall diff



  How to ADD upstream Helm chart repository:
     There are five repo commands provided by Helm which can be used for add,list,remove,update,index the chart repository.
        1. add : Add chart repository
        2. list : List chart repository
        3. update : Update the chart information locally
        4. index : For generating the index file
        5. remove : Remove chart repository


  Pass environment variables into Helm Chart:
      1. by set:
	       helm create mychart
		   helm install --set replicaCount=2 myrel mychart
           helm install --set replicaCount=2  --set replicaCount=3 helloworldrelease helloworld
     
	 2. values.yaml file
	       vi myvalues.yaml  -- add some values
		   helm install -f myvalues.yaml helloworldrelease helloworld  -- If you used diff name for values.yml file.
		   
  
  Run Helm Install with multiple values.yaml:
      helm install -f my-first-value.yaml -f my-second-value.yaml  helloworldrelease helloworld
	  
	  
	  
	  
	

All vallues can be stored in values.yaml file.
To store multiline values like labels/env use _helpers.tpl file it has a syntax as below:
---------------------------
_helpers.tpl :

{{- define "Atuls.labels" -}}
name: app
class: BE
{{- end -}}
---------------------------
Values.yml

app:
 replicas: 10
 Resources:
  requests: 
    memory: 100 Mi
    cpu: 100m
  limits:
    memory: 200 Mi
    cpu: 200m
----------------------------	
While calling this in any manifest file need to check the indentation.
----------------------------
Deploy.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: firstdeploy
    labels:
      {{- include "Atuls.labels" . | nindent 5 -}}   # nindent will give exact spaces to these line to avoid indentation error.
spec:

           image: nginx:latest   
           resources:             
             {{- toYaml.Values.app.resources | nindent 12 }}  # To fetch a set of values from Values.yml file use this syntax
{{- end -}}			 
-------------------------------------------------

To add horizontal pod autoscaler in deployment file (hpa)

Values.yml

hap:
 enabled: false
 
depoyment.yml

{{- if .Values.hpa.enabled -}}
 
apiVersion: apps/v1
